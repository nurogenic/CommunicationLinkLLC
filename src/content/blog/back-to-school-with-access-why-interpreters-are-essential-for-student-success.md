snippet: "As students head back to school, there's excitement in the air — new teachers, new classmates, and new opportunities to learn. But for Deaf and Hard of Hearing students, the start of a school year also comes with unique challenges. Ensuring these students have the same access to education as their peers isn't just important — it's essential. One of the most effective ways schools can make this happen is by providing qualified American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters."

As students head back to school, there's excitement in the air — new teachers, new classmates, and new opportunities to learn. But for Deaf and Hard of Hearing students, the start of a school year also comes with unique challenges. Ensuring these students have the same access to education as their peers isn't just important — it's essential. One of the most effective ways schools can make this happen is by providing qualified American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters.

## Equal Access from Day One

Imagine walking into class on the first day, eager to learn, but not understanding a word the teacher is saying. Without proper access, this is the reality many Deaf and Hard of Hearing students face. Having an interpreter present from the very start of the school year sets the tone that their education matters just as much as every other student's.

Interpreters ensure that Deaf students can follow classroom discussions, understand instructions, and engage fully with their peers and teachers. This not only helps them keep up academically but also builds confidence and a sense of belonging.

## Supporting Teachers and Classmates

Interpreters don't just benefit students — they help the entire classroom run more smoothly. Teachers can focus on teaching without worrying if their Deaf student is missing key information. Classmates also benefit when everyone can participate equally in discussions and group work. Inclusion creates stronger classroom communities, where differences are celebrated rather than seen as barriers.

## Building Lifelong Skills

Access in the classroom goes beyond academics. School is where students learn social skills, teamwork, and independence. With interpreters present, Deaf students are able to join in on school assemblies, after-school programs, and group activities. These experiences help prepare them for life beyond the classroom — from higher education to the workplace and beyond.

## The School's Responsibility

Providing interpreters is not optional; it's a matter of compliance with accessibility laws. But more than that, it's a commitment to equity. By making sure interpreters are in place at the start of the year, schools send a clear message: every student deserves to succeed.

## Moving Forward Together

As this school year begins, let's remember that inclusion isn't just about checking a box — it's about creating an environment where every student has the opportunity to thrive. Interpreters are a critical part of that mission, ensuring that Deaf and Hard of Hearing students walk into the classroom with the same excitement, confidence, and potential as their peers.

At Communication Link, we're proud to support schools in making that vision a reality.
