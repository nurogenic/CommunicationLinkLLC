In March 1988, the Deaf community made history with a groundbreaking movement that underscored the value of representation, inclusion, and self-determination. The "Deaf President Now" (DPN) protest at Gallaudet University, the world’s only university specifically designed for Deaf and hard-of-hearing students, became a defining moment in the fight for Deaf rights and recognition.

## The Catalyst for Change

For over a century, Gallaudet University had been a cornerstone of Deaf education and culture. However, despite being a hub for Deaf empowerment, the institution’s leadership did not reflect the community it served. Before 1988, all seven of Gallaudet’s presidents had been hearing individuals. The disconnect between the leadership and the predominantly Deaf student body had long been a source of frustration.

When President Jerry C. Lee announced his resignation, the university began a search for his successor. Among the finalists were two Deaf candidates and one hearing candidate, Elisabeth Zinser, who ultimately received the appointment. The decision to choose a hearing president over qualified Deaf candidates was met with immediate backlash.

## The Protest Unfolds

The student body, along with faculty, alumni, and allies, organized a protest demanding the appointment of a Deaf president. The protest—dubbed **“Deaf President Now”**—began on March 6, 1988. Thousands of individuals gathered, advocating for their right to have a leader who understood and represented their lived experiences.

The movement was centered around four key demands:

1. The resignation of Elisabeth Zinser.
2. The appointment of a Deaf president.
3. The resignation of the chair of the Board of Trustees, Jane Spilman.
4. A commitment that the majority of the Board of Trustees would be Deaf.

The protest included marches, rallies, and the temporary closure of the university’s campus. Protesters used banners, signs, and speeches to voice their demands, attracting national and international media attention.

## Victory for the Deaf Community

After a week of relentless advocacy, the Board of Trustees met the protesters’ demands. On March 13, 1988, Zinser resigned, and Dr. I. King Jordan, one of the Deaf finalists, was appointed as Gallaudet’s first Deaf president. Additionally, Jane Spilman stepped down as chair of the Board.

Dr. Jordan’s appointment was a momentous victory for the Deaf community. It was a testament to the power of collective action and a clear message that the Deaf community had the right to lead and make decisions about their future.

## The Legacy of DPN

The impact of DPN extended far beyond Gallaudet University. It inspired a global conversation about accessibility, representation, and the rights of Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The movement empowered Deaf people worldwide to advocate for leadership roles, equal opportunities, and full inclusion in society.

Today, DPN remains a powerful example of how grassroots activism can drive meaningful change. It is a reminder that representation matters and that communities thrive when their leaders reflect their identities and experiences.

The Deaf President Now movement was not just about electing a Deaf president; it was about affirming the Deaf community’s agency and dismantling barriers to equality. More than three decades later, its lessons resonate, inspiring ongoing efforts for inclusivity and self-representation. As we reflect on DPN’s legacy, we are reminded of the enduring power of unity and advocacy in shaping a more equitable world.
