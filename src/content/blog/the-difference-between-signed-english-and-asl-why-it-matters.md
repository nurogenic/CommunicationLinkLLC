When people think of sign language, many assume there's just one universal system. But in the Deaf and hard of hearing community, there are several forms of sign communication, each with its own purpose and structure. Two of the most commonly confused are **American Sign Language (ASL)** and **Signed English**. While they may look similar to outsiders, they are fundamentally different in how they work, who uses them, and why.

Let's break it down.

## What is American Sign Language (ASL)?

ASL is a natural language with its own grammar, syntax, and cultural history. It has evolved over hundreds of years within the Deaf community in the United States and parts of Canada. ASL is not simply “English on the hands” — it's a fully developed language with its own rules.

**Key features of ASL:**

- **Grammar:** ASL has its own word order, which is often different from English. For example, instead of saying “I am going to the store,” an ASL user might sign “STORE I GO.”
- **Facial expressions and body movement:** These are essential to convey tone, emotion, and meaning.
- **Cultural connection:** ASL is deeply tied to Deaf culture and identity.

ASL is the primary language for many Deaf individuals, and it's used in schools, homes, social gatherings, and workplaces.

## What is Signed English?

Signed English, or **Manually Coded English (MCE)**, is a system that represents English visually. It was designed to make English more accessible to Deaf and hard of hearing individuals, especially in educational settings.

**Key features of Signed English:**

- **Follows English grammar:** Signs are used in the same order as spoken or written English. For example, “I am going to the store” would be signed word-for-word in English order.
- **Uses additional signs:** Signed English often includes signs for word endings like “-ing,” “-ed,” or “-s” to match English closely.
- **Educational tool:** It's often used in schools to support English literacy development, but it's not typically used in casual Deaf conversations.

## Why Does the Difference Matter?

Understanding the distinction between ASL and Signed English is crucial for several reasons:

- **Respect for language and culture:** ASL is not just a communication tool — it's part of the Deaf community's identity and culture.
- **Effective communication:** Knowing which system someone uses or prefers ensures clearer, more respectful interactions.
- **Educational impact:** While Signed English may help in learning English, ASL provides a rich, fully accessible first language that supports cognitive and social development.
