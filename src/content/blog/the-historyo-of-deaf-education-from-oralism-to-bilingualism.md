Throughout history, the education of Deaf individuals has evolved significantly, shaped by shifting societal views, educational philosophies, and advocacy within the Deaf community. From the early dominance of oralism to the growing recognition of bilingualism, this journey highlights the struggles and triumphs of Deaf education.

## Early Approaches to Deaf Education

The formal education of Deaf individuals began in the 18th century with the establishment of Deaf schools in Europe. Charles-Michel de l'Épée, a French educator, pioneered the use of manual communication by founding the first free school for the Deaf in Paris in the 1760s. His method incorporated French Sign Language (LSF), laying the foundation for sign language-based education.

In the United States, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and Laurent Clerc founded the American School for the Deaf in 1817, where American Sign Language (ASL) became the primary mode of instruction. This period marked a time when sign language was widely used in Deaf education, leading to flourishing Deaf communities and culture.

## The Rise of Oralism

Despite the early success of sign language in Deaf education, the late 19th century saw a dramatic shift toward oralism. At the infamous Milan Congress of 1880, educators from around the world—mostly hearing—declared that oral education, which emphasized speech and lip-reading while forbidding sign language, was superior. This decision led to widespread suppression of sign languages and the dismissal of Deaf teachers, negatively impacting the Deaf community.

Under oralist policies, Deaf students were required to speak and read lips, often at the expense of their natural linguistic development. Many struggled with this method, experiencing educational setbacks and social isolation. Oralism dominated Deaf education for nearly a century, despite resistance from the Deaf community and educators who recognized the value of sign language.

## The Return of Sign Language and the Push for Bilingualism

By the mid-20th century, attitudes toward Deaf education began to change. Research by linguist William Stokoe in the 1960s confirmed that ASL was a fully developed language with its own syntax and grammar. This discovery legitimized sign language as a crucial component of Deaf education and communication.

The 1970s and 1980s saw a gradual return to sign language in classrooms, along with the rise of Total Communication, an approach that combined speech, sign language, and other visual aids. However, this method often lacked structure, leading to inconsistent educational outcomes.

In response, the Deaf community and educators began advocating for a bilingual-bicultural (Bi-Bi) approach, which emerged as the most effective educational model. Bilingual education emphasizes ASL as the primary language for instruction and English as a second language, typically taught through reading and writing. This approach not only supports academic success but also fosters a strong Deaf identity and cultural appreciation.

## Modern Deaf Education and Future Directions

Today, many schools and programs recognize the importance of bilingual education for Deaf students, though access remains inconsistent. Laws such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) have helped improve educational rights for Deaf students, but challenges remain in ensuring widespread adoption of bilingual education models.

As technology advances, tools like captioning, cochlear implants, and digital communication platforms continue to influence Deaf education. However, the fundamental right of Deaf students to learn in their natural language remains a key focus for advocates and educators alike.

The history of Deaf education is a testament to resilience and advocacy. From the oppressive era of oralism to the empowerment of bilingual education, the shift reflects a broader recognition of Deaf culture and linguistic rights. Moving forward, continued support for bilingual education and greater accessibility in schools will ensure that Deaf students receive the education they deserve, rooted in both language and identity.
