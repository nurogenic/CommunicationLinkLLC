The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has been a cornerstone of advocacy for the Deaf and hard of hearing community in the United States since its founding in 1880. As the nation’s premier civil rights organization for Deaf individuals, the NAD plays a vital role in promoting equality, protecting rights, and pushing for meaningful change.

## A Legacy of Empowerment

The NAD was established by Deaf leaders who recognized the need for a unified voice to fight for access and opportunity. Over the decades, the organization has remained steadfast in its mission: to preserve, protect, and promote the civil, human, and linguistic rights of Deaf and hard of hearing people.

## Policy Advocacy and Legal Action

One of the NAD’s most significant contributions is its work in public policy and law. The organization actively advocates at both federal and state levels to ensure Deaf individuals have equal access to education, employment, healthcare, technology, and public services.

From lobbying for captioning laws to taking legal action against discrimination, the NAD has helped shape some of the most important accessibility policies in the country. Their efforts were instrumental in the development and implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which provides crucial protections for the Deaf community.

## Promoting ASL and Deaf Culture

The NAD is also a fierce advocate for the recognition and preservation of American Sign Language (ASL) and Deaf culture. It works to ensure that ASL is respected as a legitimate language and that Deaf children have access to early language acquisition through visual learning.

Through campaigns, partnerships, and community events, the NAD highlights the importance of linguistic and cultural identity, fostering pride and connection among Deaf individuals nationwide.

## Supporting Education and Leadership

Education access and leadership development are key areas of focus for the NAD. The organization supports initiatives that promote bilingual education in ASL and English, fights for qualified interpreters in schools, and provides leadership training for Deaf youth and adults.

Programs like the **NAD Youth Leadership Camp** and the **College Bowl** encourage the next generation of Deaf leaders to advocate for themselves and their communities.

## Why It Matters

The work of the NAD goes far beyond advocacy—it inspires systemic change and empowers individuals. For businesses, educators, service providers, and allies, understanding the role of the NAD is a step toward supporting equity and inclusion.

By standing with organizations like the NAD, we help build a more accessible and just society for all.
