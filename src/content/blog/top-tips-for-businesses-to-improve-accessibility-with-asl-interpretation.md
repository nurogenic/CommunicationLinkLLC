In today’s inclusive business landscape, accessibility isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a critical aspect of ensuring equal access to services for everyone, including the Deaf community. Incorporating ASL interpretation into your business practices can significantly improve the customer experience and foster a more inclusive environment. Whether you’re a small business owner or part of a large organization, here are the top tips to improve accessibility with ASL interpretation and make your business more welcoming to all.

## 1. Understand the Importance of Accessibility in Your Business
Improving accessibility with ASL interpretation goes beyond compliance – it’s about creating an environment where everyone feels respected, valued, and included. Accessibility is vital not only for ethical reasons but also for building a loyal and diverse customer base. By ensuring Deaf customers can access your services, you demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity, which can strengthen your brand reputation and broaden your reach within the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## 2. Provide ASL Interpretation for Key Services and Events
Think about the areas where communication is most important in your business. Providing ASL interpreters for key services, such as customer service interactions, consultations, public events, and meetings, can make a big difference. For instance, if your business hosts events like seminars, training sessions, or community gatherings, offer ASL interpretation to ensure Deaf attendees have equal access to the information and activities.

Consider hiring interpreters for both in-person and virtual events, as well as for interactions where complex information is communicated, such as financial consultations, medical appointments, or legal services. For routine services, you can schedule interpreters ahead of time, and for last-minute needs, look into partnering with video remote interpreting (VRI) providers for more flexible solutions.

## 3. Partner with Qualified and Experienced ASL Interpreters
Working with qualified ASL interpreters ensures high-quality, accurate interpretation that respects the linguistic and cultural needs of Deaf clients. Qualified interpreters have undergone rigorous training, passed certification exams, and adhere to a professional code of ethics. Look for interpreters who have experience in your industry or setting, as specialized knowledge in areas like healthcare, legal services, or education can enhance the interpreting experience and prevent misunderstandings.

If you frequently need ASL interpretation, consider partnering with an interpreting agency. Many agencies can provide interpreters on-demand or as part of a scheduled service, which can streamline the process and help you provide consistent access to interpretation services.

## 4. Train Your Staff on Deaf Awareness and Communication Basics
In addition to providing ASL interpreters, educating your staff on Deaf awareness can foster a more inclusive environment. Basic training in Deaf culture and etiquette goes a long way in showing respect and understanding. For example, when interacting with Deaf customers, staff should look directly at the person rather than the interpreter, speak clearly, and avoid speaking too quickly. It’s also helpful for staff to know a few simple ASL signs, like “hello,” “thank you,” and “help,” as well as gestures to bridge minor communication gaps.

This training not only improves interactions with Deaf customers but also demonstrates your company’s commitment to inclusivity. Many organizations offer Deaf awareness training for businesses, and an interpreting agency or Deaf advocacy group can provide insights tailored to your industry.

## 5. Make Use of Video Remote Interpreting (VRI)
For businesses that may not have immediate access to in-person interpreters, Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) offers a flexible alternative. VRI connects Deaf customers and interpreters via video, providing real-time interpretation services without requiring the interpreter to be on-site. This is particularly valuable for businesses with multiple locations or for last-minute needs when an interpreter cannot physically be present.

Using VRI can enhance accessibility while saving time and costs associated with scheduling in-person interpreters. However, ensure your video platform is compatible with VRI, and test the setup to ensure high-quality video and audio. Reliable internet and a quiet space are essential for effective VRI communication.

## 6. Make ASL Interpretation Available Upon Request
Letting customers know they can request an ASL interpreter is a simple but impactful step. Displaying a sign in your business or a note on your website stating that ASL interpretation is available upon request shows your commitment to accessibility. Make it easy for customers to request an interpreter by including contact information, a request form, or a link to a customer service team that can arrange interpretation services.

For instance, if a Deaf customer is visiting a healthcare provider, they should be able to request an interpreter for their appointment in advance. This proactive approach helps avoid communication barriers and assures customers that you prioritize accessibility.

## 7. Create Accessible Digital Content
In our digital world, accessibility goes beyond face-to-face interactions. Businesses should consider making their digital content accessible to Deaf customers as well. Providing closed captions on videos, offering ASL-interpreted video content, and ensuring your website is compatible with screen readers are all important steps. If you create promotional videos, consider hiring an ASL interpreter to appear alongside the spoken content. This makes the information accessible to Deaf customers who rely on ASL as their primary language.

Accessible content not only benefits the Deaf community but also demonstrates your business’s commitment to inclusivity across digital and physical platforms, which can improve your brand image and SEO, reaching a wider audience.

## 8. Be Mindful of Privacy and Confidentiality
Privacy is a top priority, especially when handling sensitive information. If your business operates in fields like healthcare, legal services, or finance, confidentiality is crucial when working with ASL interpreters. Ensure that any in-person or virtual interpreting platform used complies with privacy laws, such as HIPAA in healthcare settings.

Working with professional, qualified interpreters also helps ensure that sensitive information remains confidential. Qualified interpreters adhere to a strict code of ethics, which includes maintaining confidentiality, so choosing a qualified interpreter provides both peace of mind and professionalism for your clients.

## 9. Seek Feedback from Deaf Customers and Interpreters
To continually improve accessibility, seek feedback from Deaf customers and interpreters who use your services. Ask about their experiences and if there are areas where you can enhance communication or streamline the process. Regular feedback helps you identify any gaps in your accessibility approach and address potential issues before they impact customer satisfaction.

You can use surveys, comment cards, or follow-up emails to gather feedback. This open line of communication not only demonstrates your commitment to improvement but also fosters trust within the Deaf community.

## 10. Commit to Continuous Improvement and Inclusivity
Finally, accessibility is an ongoing process, and true inclusivity requires a commitment to continuous improvement. Stay informed about new developments in ASL interpretation, accessibility standards, and technology that can enhance your business’s communication with Deaf customers. Organizations like the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) and Deaf advocacy groups offer resources, training, and updates on best practices.

Remember that accessibility is not just a checkbox but an integral part of creating a welcoming environment. By prioritizing accessibility, you’re helping to make your business a place where everyone, regardless of their communication needs, feels valued and included.

## In Conclusion
Making ASL interpretation a part of your accessibility strategy not only enhances the customer experience for Deaf individuals but also builds a positive reputation for your business as an inclusive and welcoming space. By following these tips, you’re well on your way to creating an environment that promotes equal access, respect, and understanding. Accessible businesses are the future, and by taking proactive steps, you’re setting a strong foundation for long-term success and inclusivity.
